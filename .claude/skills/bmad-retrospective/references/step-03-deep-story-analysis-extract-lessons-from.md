Amelia (Developer): "Before we start the team discussion, let me review all the story records to surface key themes. This'll help us have a richer conversation."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "Good idea - those dev notes always have gold in them."

<action>For each story in epic {{epic_number}}, read the complete story file from {implementation_artifacts}/{{epic_number}}-{{story_num}}-*.md</action>

<action>Extract and analyze from each story:</action>

**Dev Notes and Struggles:**

- Look for sections like "## Dev Notes", "## Implementation Notes", "## Challenges", "## Development Log"
- Identify where developers struggled or made mistakes
- Note unexpected complexity or gotchas discovered
- Record technical decisions that didn't work out as planned
- Track where estimates were way off (too high or too low)

**Review Feedback Patterns:**

- Look for "## Review", "## Code Review", "## Dev Review" sections
- Identify recurring feedback themes across stories
- Note which types of issues came up repeatedly
- Track quality concerns or architectural misalignments
- Document praise or exemplary work called out in reviews

**Lessons Learned:**

- Look for "## Lessons Learned", "## Retrospective Notes", "## Takeaways" sections within stories
- Extract explicit lessons documented during development
- Identify "aha moments" or breakthroughs
- Note what would be done differently
- Track successful experiments or approaches

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Look for "## Technical Debt", "## TODO", "## Known Issues", "## Future Work" sections
- Document shortcuts taken and why
- Track debt items that affect next epic
- Note severity and priority of debt items

**Testing and Quality Insights:**

- Look for "## Testing", "## QA Notes", "## Test Results" sections
- Note testing challenges or surprises
- Track bug patterns or regression issues
- Document test coverage gaps

<action>Synthesize patterns across all stories:</action>

**Common Struggles:**

- Identify issues that appeared in 2+ stories (e.g., "3 out of 5 stories had API authentication issues")
- Note areas where team consistently struggled
- Track where complexity was underestimated

**Recurring Review Feedback:**

- Identify feedback themes (e.g., "Error handling was flagged in every review")
- Note quality patterns (positive and negative)
- Track areas where team improved over the course of epic

**Breakthrough Moments:**

- Document key discoveries (e.g., "Story 3 discovered the caching pattern we used for rest of epic")
- Note when team velocity improved dramatically
- Track innovative solutions worth repeating

**Velocity Patterns:**

- Calculate average completion time per story
- Note velocity trends (e.g., "First 2 stories took 3x longer than estimated")
- Identify which types of stories went faster/slower

**Team Collaboration Highlights:**

- Note moments of excellent collaboration mentioned in stories
- Track where pair programming or mob programming was effective
- Document effective problem-solving sessions

<action>Store this synthesis - these patterns will drive the retrospective discussion</action>

Amelia (Developer): "Okay, I've reviewed all {{total_stories}} story records. I found some really interesting patterns we should discuss."

Dana (QA Engineer): "I'm curious what you found, Amelia. I noticed some things in my testing too."

Amelia (Developer): "We'll get to all of it. But first, let me load the previous epic's retro to see if we learned from last time."
